A makfile is included so just run 'make' if needed to build the program.
The program is hard coded to use key file 'key.txt' and should already exist.
to run the program simply use './driver file1 file2 #pixels'
For example './driver stored_fv.txt login_fv.txt 76800' will run
using 'stored_fv.txt' as the file that is stored on the server, 'login_fv.txt'
as the file being submitted by the user, and 76800 for a 240x320 pixel image.
